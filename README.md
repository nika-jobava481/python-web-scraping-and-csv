## Code Description

The provided code demonstrates how to scrape quotes from the website "https://quotes.toscrape.com" using the `requests` module and parse the HTML content using the `BeautifulSoup` module from the `bs4` library. The quotes are then written to a CSV file named "quotes.csv" using the `csv` module in Python.

The code follows these steps to scrape and store the quotes:

1. URL Setup: The URL of the website is constructed based on the page number, starting from page 1.

2. CSV File Initialization: The CSV file named "quotes.csv" is opened in write mode using the `open()` function, and a `csv.writer` object is created to write data to the file.

3. Scraping Quotes: The code iterates through 10 pages by using a `for` loop. For each iteration, it sends a GET request to the URL, retrieves the HTML content, and creates a `BeautifulSoup` object to parse the content.

4. Extracting Quote Elements: Using the parsed HTML content, the code locates the specific elements that contain the quotes using the `find_all()` and `find()` methods from `BeautifulSoup`.

5. Writing to CSV: The quote text and author are extracted and stored in a `quotesList`. The code then iterates through the list and extracts the desired information for each quote. The extracted data is printed and written to the CSV file using the `csv_file.writerow()` method.

6. Pagination: After processing each page, the `pagenum` variable is incremented to navigate to the next page, and the process continues until 10 pages of quotes have been scraped and written to the CSV file.

By executing this code, you will obtain a CSV file named "quotes.csv" containing the extracted quotes along with their authors.


Feel free to customize and utilize this code to scrape quotes or adapt it for your specific web scraping needs.
